Single Page Rails Todo App
This challenge has the exact same feature requirements as the Rails Todo App challenge. The differnece is we're building this app as a single page app instead of a classic web app.

Requirements

No authentication
Every user sees the same TODO list
The initial page must load blank
No action causes the page to be unloaded (or refresh)
Data is persisted to the server via AJAX
This time, implement the Double-click to edit a todo feature
Getting started

There is no repo to fork for this challenge. Create a new rails app using the rails new command and then push it up to github.

rails-api new todo_list --skip-spring --database=postgresql --skip-test-unit
Make your first commit:

git add . && git commit -m init
Create a new repo on github called rails-todo-app-single-page and follow their directions to push your local repo up to Github.

Stretch Goals

Deploy your app to heroku.
